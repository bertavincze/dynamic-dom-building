= Running

* Clone the repository.
* Navigate into its directory on the command-line.
* Execute `python3 -m http.server` and keep it running.
* Go to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

The last command will start-up a very simple webserver and will serve files from the directory in which you started the command on port 8080.

= Tasks:

* I'd like to click on individual posts to see related comments directly below the post I clicked.
  Clicking on another post I'd like to see comments for this post only, hide the earlier post's comments. -> DONE
* I'd like to see a user's albums (picture gallery), all of them.
  I'd like to see available albums for a user, and only that, posts shouldn't be visible in this case.
  I'd like to see albums similar to the way posts are shown currently.
* I'd like to see photos in a user's album.
  Clicking on an album should load the photos inside that album - in a way similar to the 1. story's description.
